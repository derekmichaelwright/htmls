# Calculator

R can be used as a super awesome calculator

```{r}
# 5 + 3 = 8
5 + 3 
# 24 / (1 + 2) = 8
24 / (1 + 2) 
# 2 * 2 * 2 = 8
2^3 
# 8 * 8 = 64
sqrt(64) 
# -log10(0.05 / 5000000) = 8
-log10(0.05 / 5000000) 
```

---

# Functions

R has many useful built in functions

```{r}
1:10
as.character(1:10)
rep(1:2, times = 5)
rep(1:5, times = 2)
rep(1:5, each = 2)
rep(1:5, length.out = 7)
help(rep)
seq(5, 50, by = 5)
seq(5, 50, length.out = 5)
paste(1:10, 20:30, sep = "-")
paste(1:10, collapse = "-")
paste0("x", 1:10)
min(1:10)
max(1:10)
range(1:10)
mean(1:10)
sd(1:10)
```

Users can also create their own functions

```{r}
customFunction1 <- function(x, y) {
  z <- 100 * x / (x + y)
  paste(z, "%")
}
customFunction1(x = 10, y = 90)
customFunction2 <- function(x) {
  mymin <- mean(x - sd(x))
  mymax <- mean(x) + sd(x)
  print(paste("Min =", mymin))
  print(paste("Max =", mymax))
}
customFunction2(x = 1:10)
```
`for` loops and `if` `else` statements

```{r}
xx <- NULL #creates and empty object
for(i in 1:10) {
  xx[i] <- i*3
}
xx
xx %% 2 #gives the remainder when divided by 2
for(i in 1:length(xx)) {
  if((xx[i] %% 2) == 0) {
    print(paste(xx[i],"is Even"))
  } else { 
      print(paste(xx[i],"is Odd")) 
    }
}
# or
ifelse(xx %% 2 == 0, "Even", "Odd")
paste(xx, ifelse(xx %% 2 == 0, "is Even", "is Odd"))
```

---

# Objects

Information can be stored in user defined objects, in multiple forms:

- `c()`: a string of values
- `matrix()`: a two dimensional matrix in one format 
- `data.frame()`: a two dimensional matrix where each column can be a different format 
- `list()`:

A string...

```{r}
xc <- 1:10
xc
xc <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
xc
```

A matrix...

```{r}
xm <- matrix(1:100, nrow = 10, ncol = 10, byrow = T)
xm
xm <- matrix(1:100, nrow = 10, ncol = 10, byrow = F)
xm
```

A data frame...

```{r}
xd <- data.frame(
  x1 = c("aa","bb","cc","dd","ee",
         "ff","gg","hh","ii","jj"),
  x2 = 1:10,
  x3 = c(1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3),
  x4 = rep(c(1,2), times = 5),
  x5 = rep(1:5, times = 2),
  x6 = rep(1:5, each = 2),
  x7 = seq(5, 50, by = 5),
  x8 = log10(1:10),
  x9 = (1:10)^3,
  x10 = c(T,T,T,F,F,T,T,F,F,F)
)
xd
```

A list...

```{r}
xl <- list(xc, xm, xd)
xl[[1]]
xl[[2]]
xl[[3]]
```

Selecting data...

```{r}
xc[5] # 5th element in xc
xd$x3[5] # 5th element in col "x3"
xd[5,"x3"] # row 5, col "x3"
xd$x3 # all of col "x3"
xd[,"x3"] # all rows, col "x3"
xd[3,] # row 3, all cols
xd[c(2,4),c("x4","x5")] # rows 2 & 4, cols "x4" & "x5"
xl[[3]]$x1 # 3rd object in the list, col "x1
```

---

# Data Formats

Data can also be saved in many formats:

- numeric
- integer
- character
- factor
- logical

```{r}

xd$x3 <- as.character(xd$x3)
xd$x3
xd$x3 <- as.numeric(xd$x3)
xd$x3
xd$x3 <- as.factor(xd$x3)
xd$x3
xd$x3 <- factor(xd$x3, levels = c("3","2","1"))
xd$x3
xd$x10
as.numeric(xd$x10) # TRUE = 1, FALSE = 0
sum(xd$x10)
```

Internal structure of an object can be checked with `str()`

```{r}
str(xc) # c()
str(xm) # matrix()
str(xd) # data.frame()
str(xl) # list()
```

---

# Packages

Additional libraries can be installed and loaded for use.

```{r eval = F}
install.packages("scales")
```

```{r}
library(scales)
xx <- data.frame(Values = 1:10)
xx$Rescaled <- rescale(x = xx$Values, to = c(1,30))
xx
```

---

# Data Wrangling

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

```{r}
xx <- data.frame(Group = c("X","X","Y","Y","Y","X","X","X","Y","Y"),
                 Data1 = 1:10, 
                 Data2 = seq(10, 100, by = 10))
xx$NewData1 <- xx$Data1 + xx$Data2
xx$NewData2 <- xx$Data1 * 1000
xx
xx$Data1 < 5 # which are less than 5
xx[xx$Data1 < 5,]
xx[xx$Group == "X", c("Group","Data2","NewData1")]
```

Data wrangling with `tidyverse` and pipes (`%>%`)

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # install.packages("tidyverse")
xx <- data.frame(Group = c("X","X","Y","Y","Y","Y","Y","X","X","X")) %>%
  mutate(Data1 = 1:10, 
         Data2 = seq(10, 100, by = 10),
         NewData1 = Data1 + Data2,
         NewData2 = Data1 * 1000)
xx
filter(xx, Data1 < 5)
xx %>% filter(Data1 < 5)
xx %>% filter(Group == "X") %>% 
  select(Group, NewColName=Data2, NewData1)
xs <- xx %>% 
  group_by(Group) %>% 
  summarise(Data2_mean = mean(Data2),
            Data2_sd = sd(Data2),
            NewData2_mean = mean(NewData2),
            NewData2_sd = sd(NewData2))
xs
xx %>% left_join(xs, by = "Group")
```

# Read/Write data

```{r}
xx <- read.csv("Data.csv")
write.csv(xx, "Data.csv", row.names = F)
```

For excel sheets, the package `readxl` can be used to read in sheets of data.

```{r}
library(readxl) # install.packages("readxl")
xx <- read_xlsx("Data.xlsx", sheet = "Data")
```

```{r echo = F}
DT::datatable(xx)
```

# Tidy Data

```{r}
yy <- xx %>%
  group_by(Name, Location) %>%
  summarise(Mean_DTF = round(mean(DTF),1)) %>% 
  arrange(Location)
yy
yy <- yy %>% spread(key = Location, value = Mean_DTF)
yy
yy <- yy %>% gather(key = TraitName, value = Value, 2:4)
yy
yy <- yy %>% spread(key = Name, value = Value)
yy
```

# Base Plotting

We will start with some basic plotting using the base function `plot()`

http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/r-base-graphs

https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/the-base-plotting-system-1.html

```{r}
# A basic scatter plot
plot(x = xd$x8, y = xd$x9)
# Adjust color and shape of the points
plot(x = xd$x8, y = xd$x9, col = "darkred", pch = 0)
plot(x = xd$x8, y = xd$x9, col = xd$x4, pch = xd$x4)
# Adjust plot type 
plot(x = xd$x8, y = xd$x9, type = "line")
# Adjust linetype
plot(x = xd$x8, y = xd$x9, type = "line", lty = 2)
# Plot lines and points
plot(x = xd$x8, y = xd$x9, type = "both")
```

Now lets create some random and normally distributed data to make some more complicated plots

```{r}
# 100 random uniformly distributed numbers ranging from 0 - 100
ru <- runif(100, min = 0, max = 100)
ru
plot(x = ru)
order(ru)
ru<- ru[order(ru)]
ru
plot(x = ru)
# 100 normally distributed numbers with a mean of 50 and sd of 10
nd <- rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd = 10)
nd
nd <- nd[order(nd)]
nd
plot(x = nd)
hist(x = nd)
hist(nd, breaks = 20, col = "darkgreen")
plot(x = density(nd))
boxplot(x = nd)
boxplot(x = nd, horizontal = T)
```

# ggplot2

Lets be honest, the base plots are ugly! The `ggplot2` package gives the user to create a better, more visually appealing plots. Additional packages such as `ggbeeswarm` and `ggrepel` also contain useful functions to add to the functionality of `ggplot2`.

https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html

http://r-statistics.co/ggplot2-Tutorial-With-R.html

https://www.statsandr.com/blog/graphics-in-r-with-ggplot2/

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
mp <- ggplot(xd, aes(x = x8, y = x9))
mp + geom_point()
mp + geom_point(aes(color = x3, shape = x3), size = 4)
mp + geom_line(size = 2)
mp + geom_line(aes(color = x3), size = 2)
mp + geom_smooth(method = "loess")
mp + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
xx <- data.frame(data = c(rnorm(50, mean = 40, sd = 10),
                          rnorm(50, mean = 60, sd = 5)),
                 group = factor(rep(1:2, each = 50)),
                 label = c("Label1", rep(NA, 49), "Label2", rep(NA, 49)))
mp <- ggplot(xx, aes(x = data, fill = group))
mp + geom_histogram(color = "black")
mp + geom_histogram(color = "black", position = "dodge")
mp1 <- mp + geom_histogram(color = "black") + facet_grid(group~.)
mp1
mp + geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
mp <- ggplot(xx, aes(x = group, y = data, fill = group))
mp + geom_boxplot(color = "black")
mp + geom_boxplot() + geom_point()
mp + geom_violin() + geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, fill = "white")
library(ggbeeswarm)
mp + geom_quasirandom()
mp + geom_quasirandom(aes(shape = group))
mp2 <- mp + geom_violin() + 
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, fill = "white") +
  geom_beeswarm(alpha = 0.5)
library(ggrepel)
mp2 + geom_text_repel(aes(label = label), nudge_x = 0.4)
library(ggpubr)
ggarrange(mp1, mp2, ncol = 2, widths = c(2,1),
          common.legend = T, legend = "bottom")
```

# Statistics

Under constructionâ€¦

```{r}
# Prep data
lev_Loc  <- c("Saskatoon, Canada", "Jessore, Bangladesh", "Metaponto, Italy")
lev_Name <- c("ILL 618 AGL", "CDC Maxim AGL", "Laird AGL")
dd <- read_xlsx("Data.xlsx", sheet = "Data") %>%
  mutate(Location = factor(Location, levels = lev_Loc),
         Name = factor(Name, levels = lev_Name))
xx <- dd %>%
  group_by(Name, Location) %>%
  summarise(Mean_DTF = mean(DTF))
xx %>% spread(Location, Mean_DTF)
# Plot
mp1 <- ggplot(dd, aes(x = Location, y = DTF, color = Name, shape = Name)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.7, position = position_dodge(width=0.5))
mp2 <- ggplot(xx, aes(x = Location, y = Mean_DTF, color = Name, group = Name, shape = Name)) +
  geom_point(size = 2.5, alpha = 0.7) + 
  geom_line(size = 1, alpha = 0.7) +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
ggarrange(mp1, mp2, ncol = 2, common.legend = T, legend = "top")
```

From first glace, it is clear there are differences between genotypes, locations, and genotype x environment (GxE) interactions. Now let's do a few statistical tests.

```{r}
summary(aov(DTF ~ Name * Location, data = dd))
```

As expected, an ANOVA shows statistical significance for genotype (p-value = 0.0395), Location (p-value < 2e-16) and GxE interactions (p-value < 2.52e-06). However, all this tells us is that one genotype is different from the rest, one location is different from the others and that there is GxE interactions. If we want to be more specific, we can filter the data and perform say a *t-test* to compare two groups.

```{r}
xx <- dd %>% 
  filter(Location %in% c("Saskatoon, Canada", "Jessore, Bangladesh")) %>%
  spread(Location, DTF)
t.test(x = xx$`Saskatoon, Canada`, y = xx$`Jessore, Bangladesh`)
```
DTF in Saskatoon, Canada is significantly different (p-value < 2.2e-16) from DTF in Jessore, Bangladesh.

```{r}
xx <- dd %>% 
  filter(Name %in% c("ILL 618 AGL", "Laird AGL"),
         Location == "Metaponto, Italy") %>%
  spread(Name, DTF)
t.test(x = xx$`ILL 618 AGL`, y = xx$`Laird AGL`)
```

DTF between ILL 618 AGL and Laird AGL are not significantly different (p-value = 0.7137).

# pch Plot

```{r}
xx <- data.frame(x = rep(1:6, times = 5, length.out = 26),
                 y = rep(5:1, each = 6, length.out = 26),
                 pch = 0:25)
mp <- ggplot(xx, aes(x = x, y = y, shape = as.factor(pch))) +
  geom_point(color = "darkred", fill = "darkblue", size = 5) +
  geom_text(aes(label = pch), nudge_x = -0.25) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = xx$pch) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 6:1) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 6:1) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  labs(title = "Plot symbols in R (pch)",
       subtitle = "color = \"darkred\", fill = \"darkblue\"",
       x = NULL, y = NULL)
ggsave("pch.png", mp, width = 4.5, height = 3)
```
